# Immutables sample usage

## Package org.example.simple

Most simple ValueObject

## Package org.example.tree.simple

Using immutables with a tree structure (single hierarchy).

We're using a simple dsl for the builder style (see unit test).

## Package org.example.tree.complex

Another tree structure, this one more convoluted

## Package org.example.tree.relation.inheritance

Edge relation (i.e. required attribute) modeled as a node inheritance.

IMO not very tasty.

## Package org.example.tree.relation.association

Edge relation (i.e. required attribute) modeled as association.

Better.
